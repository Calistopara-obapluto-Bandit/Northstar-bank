## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLite persistence (`backend/`)
- **Auth**: Real sign up / sign in — passwords hashed with bcrypt, sessions via JWT

Sign up creates a persistent user record (hashed password) and seeds demo
accounts, goals, and transactions for that member. The frontend stores the
returned JWT in `localStorage` and uses it to load the member's data from
`GET /api/me`; protected pages verify the token server-side before revealing
the dashboard.

### API

- `POST /api/auth/signup` — `{ name, email, password, phone? }` → `{ token, name, email }`
- `POST /api/auth/signin` — `{ email, password }` → `{ token, name, email }`
- `GET /api/me` — send the JWT via the `X-Auth-Token` header (or `Authorization: Bearer`) → member + accounts/goals/transactions

Config via env vars: `JWT_SECRET` (set a strong value in production), `DB_PATH`
(SQLite file location), and `STATIC_DIR` (optional — when set, the API also
serves the frontend from the same origin).

## Local Development

Run the FastAPI backend, which can also serve the frontend from the same origin:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
STATIC_DIR=.. uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`. Sign up creates a real account; sign back in
later to see it persisted.

To serve the frontend separately (e.g. a static host), point it at the API by
setting `window.NORTHSTAR_API_BASE` to the backend URL before `js/auth.js` loads.

## Deployment

The backend needs a server-capable host (it runs a Python/ASGI process and
writes to SQLite). Deploy `backend/` to a platform like Fly.io, Render, or
Railway; set `JWT_SECRET` and a persistent `DB_PATH` (e.g. a mounted volume).
Either serve the frontend from the same host via `STATIC_DIR`, or host the
static files separately and set `window.NORTHSTAR_API_BASE` to the API URL.

## Project layout

- `*.html` — pages (landing, dashboard, and marketing/detail pages)
- `css/` — shared stylesheets (design system + page styles)
- `js/auth.js` — auth client (sign in/up via the API, JWT session, sign out, page guard)
- `js/dashboard-interactions.js` — dashboard button interactions
- `backend/main.py` — FastAPI app (auth + SQLite persistence, optional static serving)
- `backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/pyproject.toml` — backend dependencies
- `server.js` — legacy Express server (superseded by the FastAPI backend)
